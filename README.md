# Qiskit Seminar

An introduction to Qiskit by me and Lukas Helmig in Cologne university.
The magnetization of Ising model is investigated both in real IBM quantum
computers, as well as its simulators. The results are compared. 

Note that some images are not shown in the gitlab due to path issues.
